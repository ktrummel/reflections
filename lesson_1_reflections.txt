How did viewing a diff betweenb two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It let me concentrate on just what changed.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It will let you see what bugs you made.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Cons, you may forget to commit.  Pros you commit at logically consistent times.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because they logically belong together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

With ease
